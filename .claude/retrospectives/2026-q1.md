## Issue #12: Add the ability to remove issues from the home screen

**Completed**: 2026-01-26
**PR**: [#13](https://github.com/LeeW7/ops-deck/pull/13)
**Complexity**: 7/10
**Specialists Used**: None (direct implementation)

### What Went Well
- **Phased implementation approach**: Breaking the feature into 4 clear phases (Data Layer, UI Components, Integration, Polish) made the implementation systematic and reviewable
- **Comprehensive acceptance criteria**: All 9 acceptance criteria were fully implemented and checked off
- **Clean widget architecture**: Created well-separated components (IssueContextMenu, RemoveConfirmationDialog, CloseIssueDialog) following Flutter best practices
- **SQLite migration handled correctly**: Database schema versioned properly from v1 to v2 with proper migration path
- **Cross-platform UX**: Implemented both long-press (mobile) and right-click (desktop) interaction patterns

### What Could Improve
- **No test files added**: Despite 3795 lines of production code, no test files were included in this PR
- **Mockup files in docs**: HTML mockup files (index.html, web.html) added to docs/ - consider if these belong in repo long-term or should be external
- **Code review feedback required fixes**: The PR needed a follow-up commit to address review feedback (URL encoding, deprecated withOpacity, missing notifyListeners)

### Patterns Learned
- **Database Migration Pattern**: For SQLite schema changes in Flutter, use version-based migration in `onUpgrade` callback with conditional table creation
- **Context Menu Overlay**: Use `OverlayEntry` with `GestureDetector` barrier for dismissible context menus, positioning relative to tap location
- **Undo with Timer**: Implement undo functionality using `Timer.periodic` with visual countdown and proper cleanup in dispose

### Files Created
| Type | File | Purpose |

| Dialog | `lib/widgets/dialogs/close_issue_dialog.dart` | Warning dialog for permanent close action |
| Docs | `docs/mockups/issue-12/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Technical architecture documentation |
| Docs | `docs/mockups/issue-12/index.html` | Mobile mockup (430px) |
| Docs | `docs/mockups/issue-12/web.html` | Desktop mockup (1440px) |

### Calculation Breakdown
| Category | Lines | Rate (LOC/hr) | Est. Hours |
|----------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Widget Code | 962 | 15 | 64.1 |
| Provider/State | 150 | 10 | 15.0 |
| Service Logic | 200 | 10 | 20.0 |
| Screen Integration | 100 | 15 | 6.7 |
| Docs/Config (HTML mockups) | 2383 | 50 | 47.7 |
| **Total** | **3795** | - | **153.5** |

*Note: Lines estimated per category from PR diff. Mockup HTML inflates total but is low-effort generated content.*

- **Estimated Manual Dev Time**: 153.5 hours (excluding mockup HTML: ~106 hours)
- **Actual AI-Assisted Time**: ~6 hours (across 5 commits over 2 days)
- **Time Savings**: ~100 hours (94%)

### Action Items
- [ ] Add unit tests for `JobCacheService` hidden issues methods
- [ ] Add widget tests for `IssueContextMenu` and confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Consider moving mockup HTML files to external hosting or .gitignore
