# Git Workflow Skill

Git operations for feature development.

## Configuration

- **Main Branch**: `develop`
- **Branch Prefix**: `feature/`

## Branch Naming Conventions

```
feature/[ISSUE-KEY]-short-description
```

Examples:
- `feature/INS-123-add-claim-sync`
- `feature/PROJ-456-fix-auth-bug`

## Pre-Flight Checks

```bash
# 1. Verify on main branch
git branch --show-current  # Should be develop

# 2. Pull latest
git pull origin develop

# 3. Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain
# If output is not empty, warn user about uncommitted changes

# 4. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[ISSUE-KEY]-[description]
```

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat(claims): Add claim sync from Guidewire

from Guidewire and sync to Dynamics CRM.
