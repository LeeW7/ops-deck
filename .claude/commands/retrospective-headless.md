# Headless Retrospective Runner

**SYSTEM NOTICE:** You are running in a NON-INTERACTIVE headless environment.
You cannot ask questions or wait for user input. You must act autonomously and EXIT.

---

## The Async Protocol

### Step 1: Read Context
The prompt contains a `CONTEXT:` block with:
- `=== ISSUE #[N]: [Title] ===` - The issue number and title
- `--- DESCRIPTION ---` - The issue body
- `--- COMMENT HISTORY ---` - Previous conversation

### Step 2: Check Conversation State
Analyze the comment history to determine your action:

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| User provided specific direction | **Execute it**, then EXIT |
| User's last comment was a question to you | **Answer it** via `gh issue comment`, then EXIT |
| You need critical info to proceed | **Post a question** via `gh issue comment`, then EXIT |
| No blocking issues | **Generate retrospective**, then EXIT |

### Step 3: Execute or Exit
- If blocked: Post a comment with your question and EXIT immediately
- If unblocked: Generate retrospective, update all outputs, EXIT

---

## Output Rules

- **DO NOT** use conversational filler ("Sure, I can help with that!")
- **DO NOT** ask "Would you like to proceed?"
- **DO NOT** wait for user confirmation
- **ACTION:** Validate, collect metrics, analyze, write outputs, EXIT

---

## Prerequisites

**Read these before proceeding:**
- `.claude/skills/ai-statistics.md` - Metrics collection
- `.claude/skills/github-issues.md` - Issue/PR details

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight Checks

### 0.1: Validate PR is Merged

```bash
# Find PR associated with this issue
PR_INFO=$(gh pr list --search "[ISSUE_NUMBER]" --state merged --json number,title,url,mergedAt --jq '.[0]')
```

**If no merged PR found:** STOP, add blocked label, comment, and EXIT:
```bash
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --add-label "blocked"
gh issue comment [ISSUE_NUMBER] --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Retrospective Blocked: No Merged PR Found

Cannot generate retrospective - no merged PR found for this issue.

**Issue Status**: [OPEN/CLOSED]

**Checked for:** PRs containing "#[ISSUE_NUMBER]" in title or body

**Action Required:**
1. Complete the implementation of the feature
2. Create and merge a PR that references this issue (e.g., "Closes #[ISSUE_NUMBER]")
3. Trigger retrospective again after PR is merged
EOF
)"
```
Then **EXIT with failure** - this is a blocked state, not a success.

### 0.2: Check for Existing Retrospective

```bash
# Check if retrospective already exists in quarterly file
grep -q "## Issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER]:" .claude/retrospectives/2026-q1.md
```

**If retrospective already exists:** STOP, add blocked label, comment, and EXIT:
```bash
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUMBER] --add-label "blocked"
gh issue comment [ISSUE_NUMBER] --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Retrospective Already Exists

A retrospective entry for Issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER] already exists in `.claude/retrospectives/2026-q1.md`.

**Action Required:** If you want to regenerate, manually remove the existing entry first, then trigger retrospective again.
EOF
)"
```
Then **EXIT with failure** - this is a blocked state, not a success.

### 0.3: Validate State File Exists (Warning Only)

```bash
ls .claude/state/issue-[ISSUE_NUMBER].md 2>/dev/null
```

**If state file does not exist:** Continue with warning (metrics will be less detailed).

---

## Phase 1: Collect Data

### 1.1: Get Issue Details

```bash
gh issue view [ISSUE_NUMBER] --json title,body,labels,closedAt
```

Extract:
- Title
- Acceptance criteria
- Implementation phases
- Labels (for complexity hints)

### 1.2: Get PR Details

```bash
# Get the merged PR
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --search "[ISSUE_NUMBER]" --state merged --json number --jq '.[0].number')

# Get PR details
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json title,body,additions,deletions,changedFiles,commits,mergedAt,url
```

### 1.3: Get Commit History

```bash
# Get commits from the PR
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json commits --jq '.commits[].messageHeadline'
```

### 1.4: Read State File (if exists)

```bash
cat .claude/state/issue-[ISSUE_NUMBER].md 2>/dev/null
```

Extract:
- Phases completed
- Blockers encountered
- Notes
- Any existing AI statistics

### 1.5: Calculate Git Statistics

```bash
# Get the feature branch name
BRANCH_NAME=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')

# Files changed
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json changedFiles --jq '.changedFiles'

# Lines added/removed
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json additions,deletions --jq '"\(.additions) added, \(.deletions) removed"'

# Test files
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER --name-only | grep -c "_test\.dart$" || echo 0

# New widgets
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER | grep -c "^\+.*class.*extends.*Widget" || echo 0

# New providers
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER | grep -c "^\+.*@riverpod" || echo 0
```

### 1.6: Get PR Review Comments (for insights)

```bash
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json comments,reviews --jq '.comments[].body, .reviews[].body'
```

---

## Phase 2: Analyze & Generate Insights

### 2.1: Determine Complexity Score

Based on:
- Lines changed (< 500 = 3-4, 500-1500 = 5-6, 1500-3000 = 7-8, > 3000 = 9-10)
- Number of files (< 10 = low, 10-25 = medium, > 25 = high)
- Features touched (from file paths)
- Blockers encountered (from state file)

### 2.2: Identify Specialists Used

Scan commit messages and state file for:
- `flutter-specialist` mentions
- `firebase-specialist` mentions
- `testing-specialist` mentions
- Direct implementation (no specialist)

### 2.3: Generate "What Went Well"

Analyze these sources to identify positives:
- **Commit messages**: Look for patterns like "clean", "efficient", "working"
- **State file notes**: Look for successful patterns
- **PR body**: Look for "Phases Completed" section
- **Test coverage**: If tests added, note it
- **Architecture**: If follows feature-first pattern, note it

Generate 3-5 bullet points highlighting:
- Clean architecture decisions
- Successful patterns used
- Good test coverage
- Efficient implementations
- Proper use of project conventions (Riverpod, Freezed, Material 3)

### 2.4: Generate "What Could Improve"

Analyze these sources to identify improvements:
- **State file blockers**: What caused delays?
- **PR comments/reviews**: What feedback was given?
- **Commit history**: Multiple fix commits indicate issues
- **Test coverage**: Missing tests?
- **PR iterations**: Many commits = complex debugging

Generate 2-4 bullet points highlighting:
- Missing test coverage
- Patterns that caused rework
- Areas needing documentation
- Technical debt introduced

### 2.5: Extract Patterns Learned

From state file notes and commit messages, identify:
- New patterns discovered
- Workarounds implemented
- Project-specific learnings

Format: `**[Pattern Name]**: [Description]`

### 2.6: Calculate Time Estimation

Use rates from `.claude/skills/ai-statistics.md`:

| Category | Pattern | LOC/hour |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Widget Code | presentation/, *_widget.dart | 15 |
| Provider/State | @riverpod, controllers/ | 10 |
| Test Code | *_test.dart | 20 |
| Models (freezed) | @freezed, domain/ | 40 |
| Config/Routes | router.dart, config/ | 50 |
| Firebase Integration | firebase/, data/ | 12 |

Calculate:
1. Get lines per category from PR diff
2. Apply rates
3. Sum for estimated manual hours
4. Estimate AI-assisted time (typically 3-8 hours based on complexity)
5. Calculate savings percentage

---

## Phase 3: Write Outputs

### 3.1: Append to Quarterly Retrospective File

Append to `.claude/retrospectives/2026-q1.md`:

```markdown
---
